# Air Vehicle Detector

#Purpose

This project was made to detect air vehicles. It was made for military use. The AI detects the image of the vehicle then would give out 2 different outputs depending on the two conditions shown below: 

-First if the vehicle is a threat it would warn the military that a harmfull vehicle has entered the countries premises. 

-Second if the vehicle is not a threat it would inform the military that a harmless vehicle has entered the countries premises.

#How it works

The AI would be given an image of any air vehicle (For now the AI has been trained to recognize 2 vehicles Harmless: (Hot air ballon), Harmfull: (Fighter Jet)), then it would categorize it in to its respective folder.

The AI has been given many images and has been trained to recognize Hot air balloons and Jets
